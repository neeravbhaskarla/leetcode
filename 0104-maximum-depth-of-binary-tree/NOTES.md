we will find the depth at the left sub-tree and right sub-tree, find out the maximum of 2 depths given to us by recursion, and add 1 to consider the current level i.e. root level into our depth.

**Time Complexity**: O(num of nodes) traversing all the nodes of the tree.
**Space Complexity**: O(height of the tree) for recursion.
