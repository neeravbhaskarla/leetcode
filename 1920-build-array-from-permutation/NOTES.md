**For O(1) Space**
​
using Euclid's Division, a = r +bq
​
where q>r and b is not divisible by q
​
r - holds the prev number in the initial index
bq - holds the answer, where b is length of array and q is new number to initialize.
​
where answer q can be fetched by appling division operator with size b.
