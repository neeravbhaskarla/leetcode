we will have a left and right pointer at initially zero.
​
we will check if the element at left pointer is not equal to element at right pointer then we swap the index of left+1 and right, so that next non-duplicate element will be beside of other non-duplicate element, then increment the left pointer by 1.
​
If left pointer and right pointer elements are same we increment right pointer by 1.
